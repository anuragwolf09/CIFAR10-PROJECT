Hey , This is my project on PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA). 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

Therefore here I have used PCA to reduce dimension of the data so that we can:

1.Train the model in much less time with relatively low computational power and also test the model in much less time.
2.Memory requirement will be less as data size will be less.
3.Less dimension data will be easy to visualize.

USED RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM TO FIND THE PREDICTIONS.
